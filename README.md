### 🙋🏻‍♂️ Hi, I'm Gyungin.

#### 🌱 I'm a first year PhD student in Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Dr. Samuel Albanie](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~albanie/ "abanie") and [Dr. Weidi Xie](https://weidixie.github.io/weidi-personal-webpage/ "weidi").

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on
* **[PixelPick](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/pixelpick/ "pixelpick")** which applies active learning to the semantic segmentation task. Despite using only point-level supervision, our model reveals a comparable performance with a fully-supervised model.

#### 🎯 My lifetime goal is to build systems for the common good such as making a platform which offers a fare education for all.
